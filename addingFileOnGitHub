//How to create a file or add a file on github.
If you just need to add some small file we can add directly with addfile option. and we can write the content inside it.\
But if the files are complecx and so many files are there in you local host
-----> we can use git command 
git add files_name
git status //to check files are now converted from unstaged to stagged and they aree ready to get commited and pushed.
git commit -m "write some message"
git push -u origin branch_name
